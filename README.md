# Password Strength Analyzer

A comprehensive web application that analyzes password strength through various attack simulations and provides detailed improvement suggestions.

## Features

### üîí Password Strength Analysis

- **Real-time strength calculation** with visual meter
- **Comprehensive scoring system** based on multiple factors
- **Character variety analysis** (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- **Pattern detection** for common weak patterns

### üõ°Ô∏è Attack Simulation

The app simulates various real-world password attacks:

1. **Dictionary Attack**

   - Tests against common passwords and dictionary words
   - Checks for easily guessable passwords

2. **Brute Force Attack**

   - Calculates time to crack based on character set and length
   - Uses realistic GPU processing speeds (1 billion attempts/second)

3. **Rainbow Table Attack**

   - Simulates pre-computed hash table lookups
   - Tests against common password hashes

4. **Social Engineering Attack**
   - Analyzes for personal information patterns
   - Detects predictable patterns and sequences

### üìä Detailed Analysis Results

#### Time to Crack Estimates

- Shows realistic time estimates for different attack methods
- Color-coded by vulnerability level
- Based on current computing capabilities

#### Vulnerability Detection

- Identifies specific weaknesses in passwords
- Checks for common patterns and sequences
- Detects personal information usage

#### Improvement Suggestions

- Provides actionable recommendations
- Suggests character variety improvements
- Recommends stronger password strategies

#### Hash Comparison

- Shows how your password would be stored using different hashing algorithms:
  - MD5 (insecure, shown for comparison)
  - SHA1 (deprecated)
  - SHA256 (current standard)
  - SHA512 (high security)
  - Bcrypt (recommended for password storage)

## Security Features

### üîê Privacy-First Design

- **Local processing**: All analysis happens in your browser
- **No data transmission**: Passwords never leave your device
- **No server storage**: No passwords or hashes are stored anywhere
- **Client-side only**: Works completely offline after initial load

### üõ°Ô∏è Comprehensive Testing

- Tests against extensive common password lists
- Simulates realistic attack scenarios
- Provides accurate time-to-crack estimates
- Identifies multiple vulnerability types

## How to Use

1. **Open the application** by opening `index.html` in your web browser
2. **Enter your password** in the input field
3. **Click "Analyze Password"** or press Enter
4. **Review the results**:
   - Check the strength meter
   - Review time estimates
   - Examine vulnerabilities
   - Follow improvement suggestions
   - Compare hash outputs

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients and animations
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Object-oriented analysis engine
- **CryptoJS**: Cryptographic hash generation

### Analysis Engine

The password analyzer uses a sophisticated scoring system:

1. **Length Analysis**: Longer passwords get higher scores
2. **Character Variety**: Mix of character types increases security
3. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies weak patterns and sequences
4. **Common Password Check**: Tests against known weak passwords
5. **Entropy Calculation**: Measures true randomness and complexity

### Attack Simulation

Each attack type is simulated with realistic parameters:

- **Dictionary attacks**: Test against 50+ common passwords
- **Brute force**: Calculate based on character set and length
- **Rainbow tables**: Simulate hash table lookups
- **Social engineering**: Pattern and personal info analysis

## Password Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Strong Password Characteristics

- **Minimum 12 characters** for high security
- **Mix of character types**: Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- **Avoid common patterns**: No sequences or repeated characters
- **Random combinations**: Avoid dictionary words
- **Unique per service**: Never reuse passwords

### ‚ùå Common Weaknesses

- Short passwords (less than 8 characters)
- Only letters or only numbers
- Common words or names
- Sequential characters (123, abc)
- Personal information (birthdays, names)
- Repeated characters (aaa, 111)

### üîê Storage Recommendations

- **Use bcrypt** for password storage (shown in hash comparison)
- **Avoid MD5/SHA1** for new implementations
- **Implement rate limiting** on login attempts
- **Use HTTPS** for all password transmission
- **Consider password managers** for generating strong passwords

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers

## Local Development

To run the application locally:

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. No server setup required - works entirely client-side

## Security Notes

- This tool is for educational and testing purposes
- Never enter real passwords you use for important accounts
- The analysis is based on common attack methods and may not reflect all possible vulnerabilities
- Always follow your organization's password policies
- Consider using a password manager for generating and storing strong passwords
